# QA Apple Scripts

Series of Apple Scripts to speed up QA testing

Scripts are assigned to hotkeys using Automater see: https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/run-an-applescript-with-a-keyboard-shortcut-on-macos/

Will need to run the scripts manually the first time (by double clicking on the .app file)

Works with Chrome

## jiraCommentAutofill / jiraCommentAutoFill Steps
Adds a basic test case template to the description or comment field of a Jira ticket

## jiraTicketTemplate
Copies a basic test case template to the clipboard (on older versions of Jira, writing to the description field using innerHtml wouldn't work so it required an extra manual paste step)

## jiraCommentMergedIntoMaster
Adds a 'Merged into master' comment to a Jira ticket 

## sageCardNumber
Copies a sage test credit card number to the clipboard
